# python-api-challenge
In this challenge, phyton language and some Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) was used to generate a set of about 500 to 600 city locations, retreive a number of weather data for each city, and then plot and calculate linear regression analysis. Several observations were made about the relationship betwee latitude and a number of weather indicators. In the second part of the challenge, a map was generated, in which the cities identified in Part A and their humidity conditions were represented. This was followed by the selection of cities with "ideal" weatehr conditions. Next, the nearest hotel within a 10,000 meters for each city was identified and represented in a map.
The code, analyis, and maps and scatterplots generated can be found in the GitHub repository.
