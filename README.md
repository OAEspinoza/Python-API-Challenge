# python-api-challenge
In this challenge, phyton language and some Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) were used to generate a set of about 500 to 600 city locations, retreive a number of weather data for each city, and then plot and calculate linear regression analysis. Several observations were made about the relationship betwee latitude and a number of weather indicators. In the second part of the challenge, a map was generated, in which the cities identified in Part A and their humidity conditions were represented. This was followed by the selection of cities with "ideal" weather conditions. Next, the nearest hotel within a 10,000 meters for each city was identified and represented in a map.
The code, analyis, and maps and scatterplots generated can be found in the GitHub repository. 

## Comments
I struggled with the maps for the VacationPy problem, since we did not cover hvplots in class, and this was used to generate the maps shown in the starter code. I was able to generate the required maps using gmaps (see png files in the output subfoler). I used a heatmap for Step 1 and simple markers for Step 5.
